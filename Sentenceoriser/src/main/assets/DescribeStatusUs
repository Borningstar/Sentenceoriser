both don't realise we're hipsters
both don't realise we're the Batman
both trying to be the Batman
both hate Justin
magnetically attracted to each other
both doctors
both in a noir crime novel
we've gotten drunk for the first time
we're about to get laid
we're fleeing from an angry mob
we're in a romantic comedy
we're in an action movie
we're conjoined twins
