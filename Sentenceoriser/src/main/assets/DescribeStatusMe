and I don't realise that I'm a hipster
and I don't realise that I'm the Batman
and I'm not wearing any pants
and I've just threatened to marry your sister
except I don't realise that I'm Justin
and I'm on fire but don't notice
and I'm deaf
and I'm nearsighted
and I'm your father
and I'm your mother
and I'm from the past
and I'm from the future
and I'm a hard boiled detective
and I'm in a noir crime novel
and I've gotten drunk for the first time
and I'm about to get laid
and I'm every character played by Michael Cera
and I'm a hardcore rapper
and I'm  n extremely confident, yet extremely incompetent mouth harp player
and I'm the villain of a musical
and I'm your prisoner
and I'm drunk at karaoke and didn't want to relenquish the microphone
and I have a small caliber pistol gently touching your testicles, fully loaded
and I'm fleeing from an angry mob
and I'm gay
and I'm engorged
and I'm horny
and I'm trapped in your sex dungeon
