 don't realise you're a hipster
 don't realise you're the Batman
're on fire
're pretending to be Justin
 can only speak really high pitched
 can only speak really low pitched
're on the phone
 can only speak very fast
 can only speak very slowly
're in a noir crime novel
've gotten drunk for the first time
're about to get laid
're every character played by Michael Cera
're an extremely confident, yet extremely incompetent mouth harp player
're the villain of a musical
're my prisoner
're drunk at karaoke and didn't want to relenquish the microphone
're recovering from a long night of hookers, booze, and cocaine
're fleeing from an angry mob
're gay
're drunk
a poet
're enraged
're engorged
're horny
 can only speak in riddles
 can't use vowels
're hand is possessed
